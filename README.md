# Introduction
This software (Adonis) was developed to analyze and characterize GEM detectors at Florida Tech. Using root data files that are generated using AmoreSRS to interface with the GEM detectors, Adonis can find find basic hit characteristics (strip multiplicity, gain, cluster distributions and size) as well as track reconstruction characteristics like spatial resolution

Here is a list of steps to help run and undertsand this software

First, I will show how to use AmoreSRS to load and read data. This step assumes 

# Using AmoreSRS
There are many
